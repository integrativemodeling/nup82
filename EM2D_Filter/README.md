These scripts demonstrate how to use EM2D as a filter. 
First, we use [IMP](http://integrativemodeling.org) to register models against EM class averages and then select models that satisfy those class averages the best.
Here, the filtering is applied to the Nup82 Complex.
The filtering protocol will work with a default build of IMP. The scripts require Gnuplot and ImageMagick.
