These scripts demonstrate the use of [IMP](https://integrativemodeling.org), [MODELLER](https://salilab.org/modeller), and [PMI](https://github.com/salilab/pmi) in the modeling of the Nup82 complex using DSS/EDC chemical cross-links and electron microscopy (EM) 2D class averages.

First, [MODELLER](https://salilab.org/modeller) is used to generate
initial structures for the individual components in the Nup82 complex. Then, IMP
is used to model these components using DSS/EDC crosslinks and the electron microscopy 2D class averages for the entire Nup82 complex.

The modeling protocol will work with a default build of IMP, but for most effective sampling, IMP should be built with [MPI](https://integrativemodeling.org/2.5.0/doc/ref/namespaceIMP_1_1mpi.html) so that replica exchange can be used.

## List of files and directories:

- `data`		                         contains all relevant data, input structures that were generated by MODELLER or deposited in PDB, etc.

- `template`
  
- `outputs` For reference, the models described in the Nup82 publication are
  deposited in this directory. For each of the two clusters discovered in
  the study, the cluster representative (the best scoring individual model in
  the cluster) is available in RMF format, together with the top five best
  scoring models in PDB format. An accompanying stat file contains useful
  statistics on the simulation, such as whether each of the crosslinks was
  satisfied. The localization densities, as shown in Figure 6 on the publication
  are also available, as Chimera session files.
